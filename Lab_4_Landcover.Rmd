As always, if we want to look at characteristics of this raster, we can do so

```{r}
res(nlcdSimple)
ext(nlcdSimple)
levels(nlcdSimple)
```

```{r}

forest = nlcdSimple %>% 
  setValues(NA)
  
forest[nlcdSimple ==4] = 1

plot(forest)

```


```{r}
forestPatchId = patches(forest, directions=8, zeroAsNA=T, allowGaps=F)

plot(forestPatchId)
```

## Challenge 1 (4 points)

**The landscapemetrics package has functions for calculating 12 patch-level metrics. Calculate all 12 of these for every forest patch in our nlcdSimple raster (using the 8-direction rule). This will result in 12 unique values associated with each forest patch. Use the chart.Correlation() function from the PerformanceAnalytics package to examine the correlation among all 12 of these variables. What patterns do you notice, and what do they tell you about the uniqueness or redundancy of the patch-level metrics you calculated?**

```{r}
#First metric - total area
patchArea = lsm_p_area(forest, directions=8)

#Third metric - core area index

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
